# Chart Preview
Chart Preview is an au/vst plugin for DAWs that visualizes midi notes similar to how they appear in rhythm games like Clone Hero and YARG. It's designed to make it clearer how midi note placement will translate in game. To use it, just throw the plugin on a midi channel in your DAW of choice, but use it in Reaper to leverage the sdk for 0 latency scrubbing.

This plugin supports Windows, macOS, and Linux based 64bit DAWs. Happy charting!

Big massive thank you Inventor211 for the lovely custom art assets.

#### **DISCLAIMER**

Chart Preview is in active development (v0.9.0 beta). Both drums and guitar are feature-complete with full sustain, lane support, and hit animations! REAPER integration provides direct timeline access. See [roadmap](docs/TODO.md) for current status and known issues.

### Install

See [releases](https://github.com/noahbaxter/chart-preview/releases) to download the latest builds for your platform.

##### macOS
**VST3:** Place `ChartPreview.vst3` in `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3`  
**AU:** Place `ChartPreview.component` in `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components`

##### Windows  
Place `ChartPreview.vst3` in your DAW's VST3 directory:
- **Most DAWs:** `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`
- **Steinberg/Cubase:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steinberg\VstPlugins` 
- **REAPER:** Check Options > Preferences > Plug-ins > VST for custom paths

##### Linux
Place the `ChartPreview.vst3` bundle in:
- **User:** `~/.vst3/` 
- **System:** `/usr/local/lib/vst3/` or `/usr/lib/vst3/`
- **Custom:** Check your DAW's VST3 scan paths

**Note:** I recommend you close and reopen your DAW after installation to ensure a proper plugin rescan.

### Quick Start

1. **Load Plugin:** Add Chart Preview to a MIDI track in your DAW
2. **Select Instrument:** Choose Guitar or Drums from the plugin interface
3. **Pick Difficulty:** Set skill level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert)
4. **Configure Settings:** Se your midi track #, latency (on non-reaper DAWs), frame rate, and zoom as needed
5. **Play & Chart:** Hit play and enjoy!
