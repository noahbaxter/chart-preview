# Chart Preview
Chart Preview is a vst plugin designed for Reaper that visualizes midi notes as they'd appear in rhythm games like Clone Hero and YARG. Just throw the plugin on any track with midi notes and happy charting on **Windows**, **MacOS**, and **Linux**!

This plugin relies on the reaper-sdk for tight DAW integration allowing zero latency timeline scrubbing and a host of advanced midi features, BUT it can also work in any DAW with a reduced feature set if you prefer by relying on midi lookahead (which adds latency).
