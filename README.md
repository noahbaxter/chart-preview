# chart-preview
An audio plugin for visualizing midi notes as they appear in Clone Hero and other plastic instrument games.


### Asset Instructions
For now this uses assets from the official discontinued rbprev vst which are NOT redistributed here. To build you need to place all .png files into the `Assets/` folder inside the main `RBN_prev/` folder.

This is a temporary solution.
