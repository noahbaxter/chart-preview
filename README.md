# Chart Preview
Chart Preview is an au/vst plugin for DAWs that visualizes midi notes similar to how they appear in rhythm games like Clone Hero and YARG. It's designed to make it clearer how midi note placement will translate in game. To use it, just throw the plugin in a midi track in your DAW of choice.

This plugin supports Windows, macOS, and Linux based 64bit DAWs. Happy charting!

Big massive thank you Invontor for the lovely custom art assets.

#### **DISCLAIMER**

Chart Preview is in active development (v0.7+ beta). Drums are fully usable with some quirks, guitar has more bugs but core features work. Sustained notes and lanes are now implemented! See [roadmap](docs/TODO.md) for current status and known issues.
