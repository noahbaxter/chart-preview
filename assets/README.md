# Development Assets

This directory contains assets used during development that are not part of the final plugin:

## Directory Structure

- **[development/](development/)** - Work-in-progress and experimental assets
  - `new assets/` - Updated graphics being tested
  - `old assets/` - Previous versions kept for reference

## Note for Contributors

The actual assets used by the plugin are located in:
- `ChartPreview/Assets/` - Graphics embedded in the plugin
- `ChartPreview/Audio/` - Audio samples embedded in the plugin

This `assets/` directory is for development work and experimentation only.
