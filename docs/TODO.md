## ðŸŽ¯ What To Work On Next

See [USER_FEEDBACK.md](USER_FEEDBACK.md) for full list of user requests organized by person.

### ðŸš¨ Critical (P0) - Block everything else
- [ ] **Motion sickness from scrolling** - Research + fix scroll smoothing
- [ ] **Offset/sync compensation slider** - User-facing timing adjustment

### ðŸ”¥ High Priority (P1) - Next phase
- [ ] **Default highway speed** (1.15-1.20) - **QUICK WIN** (5 min)
- [ ] **Speed slider labeling** - **QUICK WIN** (30 min)
- [ ] **Window sizing persistence** - Save/restore dimensions (1-2 hrs)
- [ ] **Automatic REAPER track detection** - Complex research (3-5 days)

### ðŸ“‹ Medium (P2) - Polish & nice-to-haves
- [ ] GUI auto-scaling to screen size
- [ ] Highway length control (configurable visible beats)
- [ ] Bottom UI elements positioned higher
- [ ] Real drums support (strategic future focus)

### ðŸ“š Low (P3) - Deferred/Future
- [ ] .ini generation â†’ suggest CAT integration
- [ ] Note length validation â†’ suggest CAT integration
- [ ] BRE support
- [ ] Extended memory
- [ ] Pro Guitar/Bass support

## ðŸ“ˆ In Progress / Partial

- ðŸ”„ Thread safety improvements (has gridlineMapLock, needs double-buffered snapshot)
- ðŸ”„ Audio-thread hygiene (eliminated duplicates, need std::function removal)
- ðŸ”„ Draw-call optimizations (batching done, need culling + pre-scaling)
