## Information Matrix

### JUCE Modifications (How We Changed JUCE)

**Primary Source**: `JUCE_REAPER_MODIFICATIONS.md`
- ✅ Explains VST2 modifications we made
- ✅ Code examples of changes
- ✅ Why everyone needs to modify JUCE
- ✅ Documents that stock JUCE doesn't work
- ✅ Links to other developers' solutions

**Also Mentioned In**:
- `development/VST2-REAPER-INTEGRATION.md` - Shows which files were modified
- `archive/REAPER-VST2-INTEGRATION-REPORT` - OLD version from when it didn't work yet

**Verdict**: Keep `JUCE_REAPER_MODIFICATIONS.md`, it's the canonical reference

---

### Working Implementation (How to Use It)

**Primary Source**: `development/VST2-REAPER-INTEGRATION.md`
- ✅ Current working status
- ✅ Architecture diagrams
- ✅ Code examples of usage
- ✅ PPQ conversion details (CRITICAL: 960:1 ratio)
- ✅ Troubleshooting guide
- ✅ Build configuration
- ✅ API access patterns

**Also Mentioned In**:
- `JUCE_REAPER_MODIFICATIONS.md` - High level, references this doc
- `archive/REAPER-VST2-INTEGRATION-REPORT` - OLD failed version

**Verdict**: Keep `VST2-REAPER-INTEGRATION.md`, it's the working solution

---

### Failed Attempt History (What Didn't Work)

**Primary Source**: `archive/REAPER-VST2-INTEGRATION-REPORT-2025-10-09-research.md`
- Documents attempt before we got JUCE modifications working
- Shows what we tried that failed
- Explains JUCE limitations we hit
- **Status**: Obsolete now that we have working solution

**Unique Information**:
- ❌ Nothing unique - everything useful is in the working docs
- Historical value only

**Verdict**: **SAFE TO DELETE** - All useful info is in working docs

---

### Original Problem Statements (Why We Needed This)

**Files**:
1. `archive/REAPER_INTEGRATION.md` (50 lines) - Original goals
2. `archive/REAPER_INTEGRATION_TECHNICAL_PROBLEM.md` (122 lines) - VST3 blockers
3. `archive/REAPER_VST2_VS_VST3.md` (85 lines) - Format comparison

**Unique Information**:
- ✅ Why VST3 doesn't work (COM issues)
- ✅ Original motivation (scrubbing, lookahead)
- ✅ Trade-offs between VST2 and VST3

**Overlap With**:
- `JUCE_REAPER_MODIFICATIONS.md` covers most of this
- `VST2-REAPER-INTEGRATION.md` has the working solution

**Verdict**: These have some historical value explaining the journey, but could be consolidated

---

### Repo Organization Docs

**Files**:
1. `REPO_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` (336 lines) - Migration plan
2. `REPO_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md` (263 lines) - Structure audit

**Unique Information**:
- ✅ Step-by-step cleanup migration
- ✅ Before/after comparisons
- ✅ Size analysis

**Overlap**: Massive - both say the same things

**Verdict**: Keep one simplified version or archive after cleanup is done

## Critical Information That MUST Be Preserved

### 1. JUCE Modifications (CANNOT LOSE THIS)
**File**: `JUCE_REAPER_MODIFICATIONS.md`
**Contains**:
- Exact changes made to JUCE source files
- Why modifications are needed
- How to apply them
- Link to our modified JUCE branch

**Risk if lost**: Cannot reproduce our JUCE setup, project becomes unbuildable

---

### 2. Working Implementation Guide (CANNOT LOSE THIS)
**File**: `development/VST2-REAPER-INTEGRATION.md`
**Contains**:
- How the working solution is structured
- PPQ conversion ratio (960:1) - CRITICAL for MIDI timing
- Code examples of API usage
- Troubleshooting for common issues

**Risk if lost**: Cannot understand or debug REAPER integration

---

### 3. Build Instructions (NEEDED)
**File**: `BUILDING.md`
**Contains**: How to build the project

**Risk if lost**: New developers can't build

---

### 4. AI Guidance (NEEDED)
**File**: `CLAUDE.md`
**Contains**: Context for AI assistants working on the project

**Risk if lost**: AI assistants lose context

---

### 5. Task Tracking (NEEDED)
**File**: `TODO.md`
**Contains**: Current project status and priorities

**Risk if lost**: Lose track of what needs to be done

---

## Safe to Delete/Archive

### Definitely Delete (No Unique Info)
1. ❌ `archive/REAPER-VST2-INTEGRATION-REPORT-2025-10-09-research.md`
   - Old failed attempt
   - Everything useful is in working docs
   - 205 lines of obsolete information

2. ❌ `REPO_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md`
   - Just created during cleanup
   - Redundant with REPO_CLEANUP_PLAN
   - Only needed during the cleanup process

### Maybe Consolidate (Some Historical Value)
1. ⚠️ `archive/REAPER_INTEGRATION.md` - Original goals
2. ⚠️ `archive/REAPER_INTEGRATION_TECHNICAL_PROBLEM.md` - VST3 blockers
3. ⚠️ `archive/REAPER_VST2_VS_VST3.md` - Format comparison

**Options**:
- Keep in archive (historical reference)
- Consolidate into one "Historical Context" doc
- Extract key points into working docs and delete

### Archive After Cleanup Complete
1. ⏰ `REPO_CLEANUP_PLAN.md` - Only needed during cleanup, can archive after

---

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Safe Deletions (No Info Loss)
```bash
# Delete the failed attempt report (superseded by working solution)
rm docs/archive/REAPER-VST2-INTEGRATION-REPORT-2025-10-09-research.md

# Delete redundant structure analysis (just created, redundant)
rm docs/REPO_STRUCTURE_ANALYSIS.md
```

### Phase 2: Consolidate Historical Docs (Optional)
Create single `docs/archive/HISTORICAL_CONTEXT.md` combining:
- Why we needed REAPER integration (scrubbing, lookahead)
- Why VST3 didn't work (COM issues)
- Why we chose VST2 (simpler API access)

Then delete the 3 separate historical docs.

### Phase 3: Archive Cleanup Plan (After Cleanup)
After cleanup is done and committed:
```bash
mv docs/REPO_CLEANUP_PLAN.md docs/archive/
```

## What Makes Information "Critical"?

✅ **Critical Information** (Cannot be lost):
- Code changes we made
- How things work now
- Build/setup instructions
- Unique discoveries (PPQ ratio, API patterns)

❌ **Non-Critical Information** (Can be regenerated/is elsewhere):
- Historical failed attempts
- Process documentation after process is done
- Information duplicated in multiple places
- Explanations covered in working docs

## Verification Checklist

Before deleting any doc, verify:
- [ ] Is this information in another doc?
- [ ] Is this information outdated/superseded?
- [ ] Would we need this to rebuild from scratch?
- [ ] Does it contain unique discoveries/learnings?

If all NO → Safe to delete
If any YES → Keep or consolidate
